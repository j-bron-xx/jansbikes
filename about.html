<p>I am an everyday-normal-guy riding motorcycles. I am riding couple years now and after most recent motorcycle trip I decided to put some of my experiences on the web.</p> 
<p>Some posts here will be purely personal relations from my trips. I treat them as a souvenirs and I write them for me and my friends.</p> 
<p>In other posts I will make an attempt to give back to the community. Hopefully some of my experiences will be enough to help a newcomer, especially the one interested in supermotos.</p>  
<p>As a general rule, informative content will be written in english. Personal, blog-like content will be in polish.</p>
