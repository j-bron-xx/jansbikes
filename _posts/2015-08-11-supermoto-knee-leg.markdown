<h2>Supermoto - knee down or leg out?</h2>
<p>So you ride a supermotard. Should you knee down or leg out in the corners? It's a very common question and there are plenty of discussions over the web.<br>
Actually I was motivated to touch this topic when I saw a youtube comment section under one of the videos. A guy was knee-down a supermoto and a lot of people reprehend the poor guy. I myself did not know what was the right way and often when leaning in the corners I asked myself <i>should I maybe knee-down? Or be more upright?</i>.</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">That was me two years ago. Sometimes knee-down, sometimes leg-out, sometimes nothing.</span>
<p>It was until recently, when I took part in small local event. The track was set up in a small parking lot but two consecutive corners on this track helped me understand the characteristics of both techniques. My idea for this post is that I will present the details of the track, describe my analysis and later elaborate on my findings. After that I would love to confront my conclusion with more skilled motard riders (hopefully).

<h2>The track</h2>
<p>Couple months passed since the event but I think I remember correctly the track. The interesting section were two consecutive corners. Here's a sketch.</p>
